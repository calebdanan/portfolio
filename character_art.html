            Both concept art and character design play crucial roles in shaping the visual identity of a project,
            providing a foundation for artists, animators, and other team members to collaborate and bring the
            envisioned world to life. These artistic representations serve as guides throughout the production process,
            ensuring a cohesive and visually compelling final result.<br><br>
